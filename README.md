### Welcome to my GitHub Page!

My name is Wyatt Duberstein, and I am a Software Engineer with a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering (Minor in Cybersecurity) from Iowa State University of Science and Technology.

I am currently working at RSM doing Custom App Development Consulting on the D365 Application. RSM is a tax/audit/consulting firm.

I am a huge music nerd (preferably anything from the 1980's and older), I play piano and guitar, and I enjoy tinkering with software and computers.

If you want a list of projects that I have worked on and sites that I self-host, check out my [personal website](https://www.wyattduber.com).

Check out my [Resume](https://resume.wyattduber.com) for more info on me and my accomplishments!
